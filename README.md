Beer Store PHP Application prior to Feb 2016 Reading Week

This application covers the work we have done in the first 6 weeks of class, including:

- Saving Data
- Reading Data
- Updating Data
- Deleting Data
- Input Validation
- Twitter Bootstrap for CSS

After Reading Week we will extend this application in the following ways:

- Adding Authentication Requirements
- Creating a Shared Header and Footer
- Incorporating Error Handling
- Adding File Uploads
- Search
- Comments and other 3rd Party Functionality

Please note these files use my own local database connection so this would need to be changed to work with your own database.
